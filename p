if internet is about search/matching/ads, what is blockchain about?

it may be about one-to-one ads [since privacy is less of an issue due to name not being tied to user profile]

if that's the case, each user can get a very personal story based on the mood and other sentiments

/btw SurveyMonkey is $2B, Qualtrics is $2.5B; curious what the key rev stream is/

LinkedIn revenue streams -- you sure about Reid's claims? http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4fa416cdecad046503000016/linkedin-revenue-by-product.png

hiring is not too bad of a market, it's the same as ads but with much more careful evaluation => space for sentiment is open. Sentiment can work for durable goods (car, house, pillow) but the rest is probably more influenced via trends, viral stories, etc Sentiments are for people.

read forbes article, its interesting

I think it's cultural misfit

not just data misclassification

at least for knowledge workers

not yet

hard to build a business wo a passion

it's not just a passion, it's a natural response on "plastic world" (–ø–ª–∞—Å—Ç–º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã–π –º–∏—Ä)

*to

and in a way a mission (–ø–ª–∞—Å—Ç–º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã–π –º–∏—Ä –Ω–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å)

cultural fit = –ú–æ—è –û–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞!

1. Human capital management is the key thing in the knowledge economy

2. people in the industry are community-lovers, value humans, fun to hang out with

3. industry veterans say it's ready for disruption: https://joshbersin.com/2017/12/people-analytics-here-with-a-vengeance/2/

4. there are a lot of things there: EdTech (eg Lynda), Performance mgmt (BetterWorks), Digital assistants (x.ai), corp as a team of teams on tours of duty (future of work org)

5. it's an analog of consumer social apps but with concrete value and less noise

6. A new category has to be defined. As they created CIO, CSO, there must be a special dept CXO. HR must go

no, looks like it's more than a toy üôÇ btw, blockchain might be the backbone of the new privacy deal in HR

AI + blockchain + digital HR

old-school OB folks go, computational/digital HR ppl come in

he has 3 ppl now, not much need for big data and privacy

maybe digital assistant
