these are special cases

well u know nothing about management and very little about tools. Barely a success story if you ask me )

I know nothing at all

in management every case is a special case

it's a plus too ðŸ™‚

well not "nothing" its just what u know is not  a reflection of a corporate realm. It can be an advantage, true.

ok gotta go

btw think of how much sense an AI tool can make of this conversation here. not that much...

https://lenta.ru/articles/2017/12/22/buterin_top/

can you actually scan this convo w one of the tools? this one should work well but I don't wanna buy it https://liwc.wpengine.com ; could do 30-day academic rental though to play w it. I think it should show smth.

are the any open-source ones that do a similar kind of a job?

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/

I actually have an account there. CoreNLP doesn't support this kinda stuff?

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Text-Analytics/QuickStarts/NodeJS#SentimentAnalysis

you just get a 'positive' score from 0 to 1.0

thats it

i bet we will be rated quite low, like 0.3

we need language categories

sentiment is great, but not enough

bottom line: you don't know what you are looking for

I know, I thought you did some cool shit w NLP ðŸ™‚

style transfer

again there no general AI

even if there would be, you won't extract much
general AI is akin to an actual manager reading chats
what can he deduce?

sentiment oth is kinda worthell - all you get is some silly measure that is unrealted to productivity

Pandora generates ~400dim vector for song

LIWC: 64+dim per text

1dim is obviously useless

yeah but 400 categories are equally worthless
why would a manager care if we talk about C++ or some python bug?

it's not about topics, it's about language categories: http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/~geoliwc/LIWC_Dictionary.htm

Great! "I think a bug in this block gives me grief. I would love to fix it."  Equates categories: Sadness, Inhibition, Sexuality.

thats how far LIWC takes you

we need to test it

this artificial sentences don't make sense

pandora works pretty fwell

not sure whether they need all 400 features but it works

Pandora does not deal with knowledge. Human language is infinitely more complex than sound vibes

we don't deal w meaning here, just categories

And I don't know what you mean by 'works'. I dont listen to Pandora, their song picking is crap

I discovered a ton of great music there

the best recommendation algo

Thats because you live under the rock.

under hard rock

anyways just sample LIWC categories. Wtf can you deduce from them?

we need to export this chat and see

kay
